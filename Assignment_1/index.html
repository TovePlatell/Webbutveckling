        <p class="article1">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong>- another
            important game
            guideline</p>

        <h2>Youtubability</h2>

        <p class="article2">A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong>to a
            potential player.

            Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting
            <strong>the
                lowest possible CPIs </strong> for your games.

            Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :
            For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
            example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective
                clear?</strong>

            Does it look <strong>fun to play? </strong>Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or
            after
            10 seconds (too long!).

            Make sure to <strong>use colours </strong>to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in
            Helix
            Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted </strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized
            as a
            threat.

        If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street, it is
        interesting to
        show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong>understand
            their</strong>
        expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and
            controls
        </strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’
        Draw
        Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</article>

            People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong> on their phone’s Facebook feed,
                <br>
            </strong>everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
            <br>
            <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a
                small
                screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, <strong> this is an accelerated elevator
                pitch!</strong>

            Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive
            thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.</article>
