                <h1>Hey Guys,</h1>

                <p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong>- another important game
                    guideline</p>
            </article>

            <article class="article2">
                <h2>Youtubability</h2>
                <img src="pictures2/phone_no1-03.png" alt="phone">
                <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay </strong>to a potential player.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting
                    <strong>the
                        lowest possible CPIs </strong> for your games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
                    example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective
                        clear?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Does it look <strong>fun to play? </strong>Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or
                    after
                    10 seconds (too long!).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Make sure to <strong>use colours </strong>to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in
                    Helix
                    Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted </strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized
                    as a
                    threat.

        If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street, it is interesting to
        show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong>understand their</strong>
        expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and controls
        </strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
        Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</article>
        
        <article class="article4">
        People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong> on their phone’s Facebook feed,
            <br>
        </strong>everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
        <br>
        <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a small
            screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, <strong> this is an accelerated elevator
            pitch!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive
        thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.</article>
